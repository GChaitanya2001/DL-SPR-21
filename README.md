# DL-SPR-21
* Implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron model from scratch for Handwritten Digits classification on the MNIST dataset. 
* Implemented a mini-inceptionnet (a version of GoogLeNet) and pre-trained on SVHN dataset for Tanh / ReLU / LeakyReLU activations using PyTorch-lightning. The pre-trained model with the best validation accuracy is loaded and fine-tuned on the CIFAR10 dataset.
